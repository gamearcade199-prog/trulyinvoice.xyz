## ⚠️ EXPECTED WARNINGS (NON-CRITICAL)

The following warnings are expected in development mode and are not blockers:

### 1. Redis Connection (Optional)
```
⚠️ Redis unavailable - Using fallback in-memory caching
Impact: None for MVP, optional for scale
Solution: Deploy Redis when scaling (Railway/Render free tier)
Status: Acceptable for production MVP
```

### 2. Sentry Monitoring (Optional)
```
⚠️ SENTRY_DSN not set - Error monitoring disabled
Impact: No automated error tracking
Solution: Sign up at sentry.io (free tier: 5,000 errors/month)
Status: Recommended but not required
```

### 3. Development CORS Mode
```
⚠️ CORS: Development mode - permissive origin policy
Impact: None (production will use strict policy)
Solution: Set ENVIRONMENT=production in production .env
Status: Expected behavior
```

## 📋 MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS (BEFORE GOING LIVE)

While all automated tests pass, you should manually verify:

### 1. Environment Configuration (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create production .env with:
ENVIRONMENT=production
SECRET_KEY=<generate-new-32-char>
SUPABASE_KEY=<rotate-in-dashboard>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<rotate-in-dashboard>
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_<your-live-key>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<your-live-secret>
```

### 2. Database RLS Policies (5 minutes)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Source: CHECK_ALL_RLS_POLICIES.sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### 3. User Flow Testing (15 minutes)
- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Upload invoice (PDF + image)
- [ ] Process invoice with AI
- [ ] Export to Excel
- [ ] Export to CSV
- [ ] Test payment flow
- [ ] Test quota limits

### 4. Security Testing (10 minutes)
- [ ] Try 25 uploads rapidly (should hit rate limit)
- [ ] Verify CORS in production mode
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify new Supabase keys work
