## Remaining: Search Console Verification

### Step 1: Get Verification Code

2. Add property: `trulyinvoice.xyz`
3. Choose verification method: **HTML tag** or **TXT DNS record**

### Step 2: For HTML Tag Verification
If using HTML tag method, update `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~91 in layout.tsx
verification: {
  google: 'YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE',
},
```

Extract the `content` value from Google's verification meta tag and replace `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE`.

### Step 3: Submit Sitemap
After verification is complete:
1. Go to Sitemaps section in Search Console
2. Add new sitemap: `https://trulyinvoice.xyz/sitemap.xml`
3. Wait for Google to crawl (24-48 hours)

### Step 4: Monitor Performance
- **Index Coverage:** Check for crawl errors
- **Performance:** Monitor organic traffic
- **Mobile Usability:** Should pass (Tailwind + responsive design)
