## 🔧 BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### Bug #1: Invoice Date Validation ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** Validator wasn't rejecting invoices where due_date is before invoice_date  
**Test:** `test_due_date_before_invoice_date_warning` was FAILING  

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added to backend/app/services/invoice_validator.py
# Validates that due_date is not before invoice_date
if 'invoice_date' in cleaned_data and 'due_date' in cleaned_data:
    inv_date_val = cleaned_data.get('invoice_date')
    due_date_val = cleaned_data.get('due_date')
    
    if inv_date_val and due_date_val:
        try:
            inv_dt = datetime.strptime(inv_date_val, '%Y-%m-%d')
            due_dt = datetime.strptime(due_date_val, '%Y-%m-%d')
            
            if due_dt < inv_dt:
                errors.append(f"due_date ({due_date_val}) cannot be before invoice_date ({inv_date_val})")
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass
```

**Status After Fix:** ✅ NOW PASSING
