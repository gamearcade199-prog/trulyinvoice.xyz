### What's Missing:
❌ Blog = Zero organic search authority
❌ Backlinks = Can't rank #1
❌ Media mentions = No credibility
❌ Video = No engagement multiplier
❌ GMB = No local discovery

### The Opportunity:
The "invoice to excel" niche is virtually uncontested in India. Zoho dominates "invoice software" but not "invoice to excel" specifically. With the right content + authority building, you can own this niche completely within 12 months.
