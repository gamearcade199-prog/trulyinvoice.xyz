═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
💡 MY TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS (START HERE!)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🥇 #1: PAYMENT STATUS TRACKING
   Why: This is THE killer feature. Users upload invoices to track
        if they're paid or not. Without this, your app is just
        a fancy PDF storage.
   
   Time: 2-3 hours to implement
   Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (GAME CHANGER)

🥈 #2: DASHBOARD WITH ANALYTICS
   Why: First impression matters. A beautiful dashboard with
        stats (total spent, paid vs unpaid, top vendors) makes
        users feel professional and in control.
   
   Time: 4-6 hours to implement
   Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (WOW FACTOR)

🥉 #3: INVOICE DETAILS PAGE
   Why: Currently no way to see full invoice details or edit
        if AI got something wrong. This is frustrating for users.
   
   Time: 3-4 hours to implement
   Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (ESSENTIAL)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎁 BONUS: FEATURES YOUR COMPETITORS HAVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Looking at similar apps (Expensify, Zoho Expense, etc.):

✅ You Have:
- AI extraction (GOOD!)
- Multi-user (GOOD!)
- Bulk operations (GOOD!)
- Image OCR (EXCELLENT!)

❌ You're Missing:
- Payment tracking (CRITICAL!)
- Analytics dashboard (CRITICAL!)
- Categories/tags
- Expense reports
- Team collaboration
- Mobile app

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📝 SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your app has a SOLID foundation with AI extraction and multi-user
support. But to compete and retain users, you MUST add:

1. Payment Status Tracking (paid/unpaid)
2. Dashboard with Analytics (financial overview)
3. Invoice Details Page (view/edit full info)

These 3 features will transform your app from "neat AI demo" to
"must-have business tool" that people will actually pay for.

The rest can come later based on user feedback.
