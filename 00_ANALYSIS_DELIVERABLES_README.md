```
‚úó Payment Processing    (0% coverage - $$$$ risk)
‚úó Export Functionality  (0% coverage - CSV/Excel/PDF)
‚úó RLS Policies         (0% coverage - Data leak risk)
‚úó Invoice Upload       (0% coverage - Core feature)
‚úó AI Extraction        (0% coverage - 3 provider fallback)
‚úó API Endpoints        (95+ routes, only 5 tested)
```

### Frontend: 23 Components + 20 Pages
