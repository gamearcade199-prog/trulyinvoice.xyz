# Invoice Export Fix - Quick Reference

## 🐛 Problem
Invoice exporters (Excel, PDF, CSV) were not working after clicking "View Invoice"

## ✅ Root Causes Fixed

### Issue 1: Hardcoded Backend URL
**Frontend** was using `http://localhost:8000` hardcoded URL
- ❌ Failed when backend was on different host/port
- ❌ Failed in production
- ✅ Now uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

**File**: `frontend/src/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`
- Line 183: `exportToExcel()` - FIXED
- Line 219: `exportToPDF()` - FIXED  
- Line 255: `exportToCSV()` - FIXED

### Issue 2: Missing Logger Import
**Backend** was using logger without importing it
- ❌ Would crash with `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined`
- ✅ Added `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`

**File**: `backend/app/api/invoices.py`
- Line 9: Added `import logging`
- Line 12: Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`

## 📋 Export Flow

```
User clicks export button
        ↓
Frontend gets auth token
        ↓
Frontend calls: ${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/invoices/{id}/export-{format}
        ↓
Backend validates JWT token
        ↓
Backend queries invoice from Supabase
        ↓
Backend uses appropriate exporter:
  • PDF → HTMLProfessionalPDFExporter
  • Excel → AccountantExcelExporter
  • CSV → CSVExporter
        ↓
Backend returns file
        ↓
Browser downloads file
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] 1. Backend running: `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- [ ] 2. Frontend running: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- [ ] 3. Log in to app
- [ ] 4. Upload an invoice
- [ ] 5. Go to Invoices page
- [ ] 6. Click on invoice to view details
- [ ] 7. Click "Download PDF" → should download PDF file
- [ ] 8. Click "Export to Excel" → should download XLSX file
- [ ] 9. Click "Export to CSV" → should download CSV file
