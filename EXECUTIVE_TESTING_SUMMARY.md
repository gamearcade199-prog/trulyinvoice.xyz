## üé≤ RISK ASSESSMENT

### Critical Risk Areas (Fix Before Launch)

#### 1. Payment Processing
**Current:** No automated tests  
**Risk:** Users can't upgrade ‚Üí No revenue  
**Impact:** $10K+ per failed payment (reputation + lost customers)  
**Test Effort:** 2-3 days  

```python
# What COULD break:
- Razorpay signature validation fails
- Duplicate payment processed twice
- User B's payment credited to User A
- Refund not processed
- Subscription not activated
```

#### 2. User Data Isolation
**Current:** RLS policies set but not verified  
**Risk:** User A sees User B's data ‚Üí GDPR violation  
**Impact:** $50K+ in fines + reputation  
**Test Effort:** 1-2 days

```sql
-- What COULD break:
SELECT * FROM invoices -- Who can see this?
SELECT * FROM audit_logs -- Should be isolated!
UPDATE invoices SET payment_status = 'paid' -- Who can do this?
```

#### 3. Invoice Export
**Current:** 3 export formats, 0 tests  
**Risk:** Files corrupted, data lost, wrong format  
**Impact:** Support tickets, customer churn  
**Test Effort:** 2-3 days

```python
# What COULD break:
- Special characters not encoded properly
- Large files crash
- Excel formatting breaks
- PDF rendering incorrect
- Timezone conversion wrong
```

#### 4. AI Extraction Fallback
**Current:** 3 AI providers configured, fallback untested  
**Risk:** All AI providers fail ‚Üí Feature not working  
**Impact:** Core feature broken for all users  
**Test Effort:** 1-2 days

```python
# What COULD break:
- OpenAI API timeout ‚Üí doesn't fallback to Gemini
- Gemini fails ‚Üí doesn't fallback to Vision API
- All fail ‚Üí no error message to user
- Partial data extracted ‚Üí not marked as incomplete
```

#### 5. Authentication & Sessions
**Current:** Basic auth set up, edge cases untested  
**Risk:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access  
**Impact:** Data breach, legal liability  
**Test Effort:** 2-3 days

```python
# What COULD break:
- Token expiration not enforced
- Refresh token not rotating
- Session doesn't timeout on inactivity
- CSRF tokens not validated
```

## üéì FINAL THOUGHTS

### You've Built Something Great üéâ
- Clean code architecture
- Modern tech stack
- Good UI/UX
- Solid security foundation

### The Final Mile ‚õ≥
- Most projects fail at the "final 20%"
- That 20% is testing & quality assurance
- Test investment = confidence in launch
- High confidence = successful scaling

### Launch Strategy
```
Option 1: Soft Launch (RECOMMENDED)
- Launch to 10-20 beta users
- 75+ critical tests passing
- Monitor for 2 weeks
- Then full launch

Option 2: Full Launch (RISKY)
- <50% tests = high risk
- Only if business demands it
- Have incident response ready

Option 3: Delayed Launch (SAFE)
- Wait for 250+ tests
- 90%+ coverage on critical paths
- Zero known issues
- Launch with confidence
```

**Recommendation:** Soft launch with 75 tests ‚Üí gather feedback ‚Üí launch fully with 250+ tests
