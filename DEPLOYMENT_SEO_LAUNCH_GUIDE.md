## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Pages not appearing in search results
**Solution:**
1. Check GSC Coverage tab for errors
2. Verify robots.txt allows /pages
3. Request indexing manually in GSC URL Inspection
4. Check canonicalization - no redirect chains

### Issue: Low traffic from organic
**Expected:** First 30 days may have 0 traffic as pages index
**Solution:**
1. Wait 30 days for full indexing
2. Blog posts need 2-4 weeks to show in rankings
3. Continue adding content
4. Build backlinks (Phase 3)

### Issue: Core Web Vitals failing
**Solution:**
1. Use PageSpeed Insights to identify issue
2. Usually: image optimization, code splitting
3. Already optimized in next.config.js
4. If still issues: contact hosting support

### Issue: Schema validation errors
**Solution:**
1. Go to Rich Results Test
2. Check specific error messages
3. Common: Missing required fields, wrong data types
4. We've implemented correctly - likely just warnings
