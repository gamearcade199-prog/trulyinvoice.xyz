## 📊 ANALYSIS AT A GLANCE

### Current State
```
Code Quality:        ✅ 80% - Very good (0 build errors, 0 warnings)
Test Coverage:       ⚠️  6% - Critical gap (26/415 tests)
Production Ready:    🔴 NO - Needs 150-250 more tests
Risk Level:          🔴 HIGH - Multiple critical untested areas
Timeline to Ready:   📅 3-4 weeks
```

### What's Critical (Must Test Before Launch)

User Data Isolation ❌    → GDPR violation risk
Invoice Export ❌         → Core feature broken
Authentication ⚠️        → Security risk
AI Extraction Fallback ❌ → Service outage
```

### Testing Roadmap
```
Week 1-2:  75 tests  (Critical path)     → 40-50% coverage
Week 3:   100 tests  (Core features)     → 65-75% coverage  
Week 4:   100 tests  (Full coverage)     → 85-90% coverage
LAUNCH:         Ready with confidence ✅
