# Invoice Export Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
After clicking "View Invoice" and attempting to use export functionality (Excel, PDF, CSV), the exports were failing silently.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Hardcoded localhost URLs** (Frontend)
**File**: `frontend/src/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`

**Problem**: 
- Export functions were using hardcoded `http://localhost:8000` URLs
- When backend runs on different host/port or in production, requests would fail
- All three export endpoints had this issue:
  - `exportToExcel()`
  - `exportToPDF()`
  - `exportToCSV()`

**Example of broken code**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/invoices/${invoiceId}/export-excel`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}` }
})
```

### 2. **Missing Logger Import** (Backend)
**File**: `backend/app/api/invoices.py`

**Problem**:
- Backend code was using `logger.warning()` in exception handlers
- But `logging` module was not imported
- This would cause `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` if exceptions occurred during export

**Fix Applied**:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Replace Hardcoded URLs with Environment Variable
**File**: `frontend/src/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changed all three export functions from**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/invoices/${invoiceId}/export-excel`, {
```

**To**:
```typescript
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'
const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/invoices/${invoiceId}/export-excel`, {
```

**Applied to**:
- Line ~178: `exportToExcel()`
- Line ~207: `exportToPDF()`
- Line ~250: `exportToCSV()`

### Fix 2: Add Missing Logger Import
**File**: `backend/app/api/invoices.py`

**Added**:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

**Why**: Prevents crashes in exception handlers at lines 164, 229, and 295

## Backend Export Endpoints
All three export endpoints are properly configured:

✅ **PDF Export**: `GET /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/export-pdf`
- Uses `HTMLProfessionalPDFExporter`
- Returns professional PDF with formatting
- Target users: Clients, Business Owners

✅ **Excel Export**: `GET /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/export-excel`
- Uses `AccountantExcelExporter`
- Returns accountant-friendly Excel
- Target users: Accountants, Bookkeepers, Tally/QuickBooks users

✅ **CSV Export**: `GET /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/export-csv`
- Uses `CSVExporter`
- Returns simple CSV format
- Target users: Data analysts, spreadsheet users

## Authentication
All export endpoints require:
- `Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}` header
- Valid Supabase auth token
- User must be logged in

The `get_current_user()` dependency validates the token and extracts the user ID.

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks export button** in invoice detail view
2. **Frontend** gets access token from Supabase auth
3. **Frontend** calls backend: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/invoices/{id}/export-{format}`
4. **Backend** validates authentication
5. **Backend** queries invoice from Supabase
6. **Backend** formats invoice using appropriate exporter
7. **Backend** returns file as download
8. **Browser** downloads file with proper filename

## Environment Variable
Ensure `.env.local` includes:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Or in production:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. ✅ Login to the application
2. ✅ Upload an invoice (creates invoice record)
3. ✅ Navigate to Invoices page
4. ✅ Click on an invoice to view details
5. ✅ Click "Download PDF" button - should download PDF file
6. ✅ Click "Export to Excel" button - should download XLSX file
7. ✅ Click "Export to CSV" button - should download CSV file

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed 3 export URLs
2. `backend/app/api/invoices.py` - Added logging import

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All export functionality should now work correctly
