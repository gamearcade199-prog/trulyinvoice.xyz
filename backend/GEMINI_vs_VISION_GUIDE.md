## 🔄 How Gemini OCR Works for Invoices

### Step 1: Upload Invoice
```
User uploads: Invoice.pdf or Invoice.jpg
```

### Step 2: Gemini "Looks" at Invoice
```python
response = model.generate_content([
    invoice_image,
    "Extract invoice as JSON"
])
```

### Step 3: Gemini Understands
```
Gemini sees:
- "Invoice #" → invoice_number field
- "Total: $1000" → total_amount field
- "ABC Corp" → vendor_name field
- "pending" → payment_status field
```

### Step 4: Returns Structured Data
```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-001",
  "vendor_name": "ABC Corp",
  "total_amount": 1000.00,
  "payment_status": "unpaid",
  "line_items": [...]
}
```

### Step 5: Saved to Database
```sql
INSERT INTO invoices (invoice_number, vendor_name, total_amount, ...)
VALUES ('INV-001', 'ABC Corp', 1000.00, ...)
```
